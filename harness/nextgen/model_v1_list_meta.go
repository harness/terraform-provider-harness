type V1ListMeta struct {
	// selfLink is a URL representing this object. Populated by the system. Read-only.  DEPRECATED Kubernetes will stop propagating this field in 1.20 release and the field is planned to be removed in 1.21 release. +optional
	SelfLink        string `json:"selfLink,omitempty"`
	ResourceVersion string `json:"resourceVersion,omitempty"`
	// continue may be set if the user set a limit on the number of items returned, and indicates that the server has more data available. The value is opaque and may be used to issue another request to the endpoint that served this list to retrieve the next set of available objects. Continuing a consistent list may not be possible if the server configuration has changed or more than a few minutes have passed. The resourceVersion field returned when using this continue value will be identical to the value in the first response, unless you have received this token from an error message.
	Continue_          string `json:"continue,omitempty"`
	RemainingItemCount string `json:"remainingItemCount,omitempty"`
