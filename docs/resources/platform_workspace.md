## Schema

### Required

- `cost_estimation_enabled` (Boolean) Cost estimation enabled determines if cost estimation operations are performed.
- `identifier` (String) Unique identifier of the resource.
- `name` (String) Name of the resource.
- `org_id` (String) Unique identifier of the organization.
- `project_id` (String) Unique identifier of the project.
- `provider_connector` (String) Provider connector is the reference to the connector for the infrastructure provider
- `provisioner_type` (String) Provisioner type defines the provisioning tool to use. Currently only terraform is supported.
- `provisioner_version` (String) Provisioner version defines the tool version to use. Currently we support versions of terraform less than or equal 1.5.6
- `repository` (String) Repository is the name of the repository to fetch the code from.
- `repository_connector` (String) Repository connector is the reference to the connector used to fetch the code.
- `repository_path` (String) Repository path is the path in which the code resides.

### Optional

- `description` (String) Description of the resource.
- `environment_variable` (Block Set) Environment variables configured on the workspace (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--environment_variable))
- `repository_branch` (String) Repository branch is the name of the branch to fetch the code from. This cannot be set if repository commit or sha is set.
- `repository_commit` (String) Repository commit is tag to fetch the code from. This cannot be set if repository branch or sha is set.
- `repository_sha` (String) Repository commit is sha to fetch the code from. This cannot be set if repository branch or commit is set.
- `tags` (Set of String) Tags to associate with the resource.
- `terraform_variable` (Block Set) Terraform variables configured on the workspace. Terraform variable keys must be unique within the workspace. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--terraform_variable))
- `terraform_variable_file` (Block Set) Terraform variables files configured on the workspace (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--terraform_variable_file))
- `variable_sets` (Set of String) Variable set identifiers. Currently support only one variable set.

### Read-Only

### Nested Schema for `environment_variable`

Required:

- `key` (String) Key is the identifier for the variable. Must be unique within the workspace.
