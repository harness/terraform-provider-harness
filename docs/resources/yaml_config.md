# harness_yaml_config (Resource)

Resource for creating a raw YAML configuration in Harness. Note: This works for all objects EXCEPT application objects. This resource uses the config-as-code API's. When updating the `name` or `path` of this resource you should typically also set the `create_before_destroy = true` lifecycle setting.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "harness_yaml_config" "test" {
  path    = "Setup/Cloud Providers/Kubernetes.yaml"
  content = <<EOF
harnessApiVersion: '1.0'
type: KUBERNETES_CLUSTER
delegateSelectors:
- k8s
skipValidation: true
useKubernetesDelegate: true
EOF
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `content` (String) The raw YAML configuration.
- `path` (String) The path of the resource.

### Optional

- `app_id` (String) The id of the application. This is required for all resources except global ones.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The unique id of the resource.
- `name` (String) The name of the resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Importing a global config only using the yaml path
terraform import harness_yaml_config.k8s_cloudprovider "Setup/Cloud Providers/kubernetes.yaml"

# Importing a service which requires both the application id and the yaml path.
terraform import harness_yaml_config.k8s_cloudprovider "Setup/Applications/MyApp/Services/MyService/Index.yaml:<APPLICATION_ID>"
```
