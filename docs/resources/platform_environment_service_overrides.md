## Schema

### Required

- `env_id` (String) The env ID to which the overrides associated.
- `service_id` (String) The service ID to which the overrides applies.
- `yaml` (String) Environment Service Overrides YAML. In YAML, to reference an entity at the organization scope, prefix 'org' to the expression: org.{identifier}. To reference an entity at the account scope, prefix 'account` to the expression: account.{identifier}. For eg, to reference a connector with identifier 'connectorId' at the organization scope in a stage mention it as connectorRef: org.connectorId.

### Optional

- `identifier` (String) identifier of the service overrides.
- `org_id` (String) Unique identifier of the organization.
- `project_id` (String) Unique identifier of the project.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Import list of account level service overrides using the env id associated with them
terraform import harness_platform_environment_service_overrides.example <env_id>

# Import list of org level service overrides using the env id associated with them
terraform import harness_platform_environment_service_overrides.example <org_id>/<env_id>

# Import list of project level service overrides using the env id associated with them
terraform import harness_platform_environment_service_overrides.example <org_id>/<project_id>/<env_id>
```
