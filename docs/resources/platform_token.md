# harness_platform_token (Resource)

Resource for creating tokens.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create token for account level apikey
resource "harness_platform_token" "test" {
  identifier  = "test_token"
  name        = "test token"
  parent_id   = "apikey_parent_id"
  account_id  = "account_id"
  apikey_type = "USER"
  apikey_id   = "apikey_id"
}

# Create token for org level apikey
resource "harness_platform_token" "test" {
  identifier  = "test_token"
  name        = "test token"
  parent_id   = "apikey_parent_id"
  account_id  = "account_id"
  org_id      = "org_id"
  apikey_type = "SERVICE_ACCOUNT"
  apikey_id   = "apikey_id"
}

# Create token for project level apikey
resource "harness_platform_token" "test" {
  identifier  = "test_token"
  name        = "test token"
  parent_id   = "apikey_parent_id"
  account_id  = "account_id"
  org_id      = "org_id"
  project_id  = "project_id"
  apikey_type = "SERVICE_ACCOUNT"
  apikey_id   = "apikey_id"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `account_id` (String) Account Identifier for the Entity
- `apikey_id` (String) Identifier of the API Key
- `apikey_type` (String) Type of the API Key
- `identifier` (String) Unique identifier of the resource.
- `name` (String) Name of the resource.
- `parent_id` (String) Parent Entity Identifier of the API Key

### Optional

- `description` (String) Description of the resource.
- `email` (String) Email Id of the user who created the Token
- `encoded_password` (String) Encoded password of the Token
- `org_id` (String) Unique identifier of the organization.
- `project_id` (String) Unique identifier of the project.
- `scheduled_expire_time` (Number) Scheduled expiry time in milliseconds
- `tags` (Set of String) Tags to associate with the resource.
- `username` (String) Name of the user who created the Token
- `valid` (Boolean) Boolean value to indicate if Token is valid or not.
- `valid_from` (Number) This is the time from which the Token is valid. The time is in milliseconds
- `valid_to` (Number) This is the time till which the Token is valid. The time is in milliseconds

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `value` (String, Sensitive) Value of the Token

### Important Note: Managing resource dependency order.

Terraform determines deletion order based on resource dependencies. To avoid unexpected behavior, it’s recommended to define explicit `depends_on` blocks so resources are created and destroyed in the correct sequence.

The expected order is:

* **Create:** Service Account → API Key → Token
* **Destroy:** Token → API Key → Service Account

You can enforce this explicitly in your Terraform configuration:

```terraform
resource "harness_platform_token" "token" {
  ...
  depends_on = [harness_platform_apikey.apikey]
}

resource "harness_platform_apikey" "apikey" {
  ...
  depends_on = [harness_platform_service_account.service_account]
}
```

This ensures Terraform manages these resources in the proper order during both creation and deletion.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Import account level token
terraform import harness_platform_token <parent_id>/<apikey_id>/<apikey_type>/<token_id>

# Import org level token
terraform import harness_platform_token <org_id>/<parent_id>/<apikey_id>/<apikey_type>/<token_id>

# Import project level token
terraform import harness_platform_token <org_id>/<project_id>/<parent_id>/<apikey_id>/<apikey_type>/<token_id>
```
