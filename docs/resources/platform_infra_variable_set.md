# harness_platform_infra_variable_set (Resource)

Resource for managing infrastructure Variable Sets

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "harness_platform_infra_variable_set" "example" {
  identifier  = "example"
  name        = "example"
  org_id      = harness_platform_organization.test.id
  project_id  = harness_platform_project.test.id
  description = "some description"

  environment_variable {
    key        = "key1"
    value      = "value1"
    value_type = "string"
  }
  environment_variable {
    key        = "key2"
    value      = "harness_platform_secret_text.test.id"
    value_type = "secret"
  }

  terraform_variable {
    key        = "key1"
    value      = "1111"
    value_type = "string"
  }
  terraform_variable {
    key        = "key2"
    value      = "1111u"
    value_type = "string"
  }

  terraform_variable_file {
    repository           = "https://github.com/org/repo"
    repository_branch    = "main"
    repository_path      = "tf/aws/basic"
    repository_connector = "harness_platform_connector_github.test.id"
  }
  terraform_variable_file {
    repository           = "https://github.com/org/repo"
    repository_branch    = "br2"
    repository_path      = "tf/aws/basic"
    repository_connector = "harness_platform_connector_github.test.id"
  }

  connector {
    connector_ref = "harness_platform_connector_aws.test.id"
    type          = "aws"
  }
  connector {
    connector_ref = "harness_platform_connector_azure.test.id"
    type          = "azure"
  }

## Schema

### Required

- `identifier` (String) Unique identifier of the resource.
- `name` (String) Name of the resource.

### Optional

- `org_id` (String) Unique identifier of the organization.
- `project_id` (String) Unique identifier of the project.
- `description` (String) Description of the resource.
- `environment_variable` (Block Set) Environment variables configured on the variable set (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--environment_variable))
- `terraform_variable` (Block Set) Terraform variables configured on the variable set. Terraform variable keys must be unique within the variable set. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--terraform_variable))
- `terraform_variable_file` (Block Set) Terraform variables files configured on the variable set (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--terraform_variable_file))
- `connector` (Block Set) Provider connector configured on the variable set (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--connector))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--environment_variable"></a>
### Nested Schema for `environment_variable`

Required:

- `key` (String) Key is the identifier for the variable. Must be unique within the variable set.
- `value` (String) Value is the value of the variable. For string value types this field should contain the value of the variable. For secret value types this should contain a reference to a valid harness secret.
- `value_type` (String) Value type indicates the value type of the variable. Currently we support string and secret.


<a id="nestedblock--terraform_variable"></a>
### Nested Schema for `terraform_variable`

Required:

- `key` (String) Key is the identifier for the variable. Must be unique within the variable set.
- `value` (String) Value is the value of the variable. For string value types this field should contain the value of the variable. For secret value types this should contain a reference to a valid harness secret.
- `value_type` (String) Value type indicates the value type of the variable. Currently we support string and secret.

### Nested Schema for `terraform_variable_file`

Required:

- `repository` (String) Repository is the name of the repository to fetch the code from.
- `repository_connector` (String) Repository connector is the reference to the connector used to fetch the variables.

Optional:

- `repository_branch` (String) Repository branch is the name of the branch to fetch the variables from. This cannot be set if repository commit or sha is set
- `repository_commit` (String) Repository commit is tag to fetch the variables from. This cannot be set if repository branch or sha is set.
- `repository_sha` (String) Repository commit is sha to fetch the variables from. This cannot be set if repository branch or commit is set.
- `repository_path` (String) Repository path is the path in which the variables reside.


<a id="nestedblock--connector"></a>
### Nested Schema for `connector`

Required:

- `connector_ref` (String) Unique identifier of the connector.
- `type` (String) Type indicates the type of the connector. Currently we support aws, azure, gcp.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import harness_platform_infra_variable_set.example <varset_id>
terraform import harness_platform_infra_variable_set.example <org_id>/<varset_id>
