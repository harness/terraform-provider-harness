```shell
# Import account level aws cloud cost connector 
terraform import harness_platform_connector_awscc.example <connector_id>

# Import org level aws cloud cost connector 
terraform import harness_platform_connector_awscc.example <ord_id>/<connector_id>

# Import project level aws cloud cost connector 
terraform import harness_platform_connector_awscc.example <org_id>/<project_id>/<connector_id>
