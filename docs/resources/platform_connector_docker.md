## Example to create Docker Connector at different levels (Org, Project, Account)
### Account Level
```terraform
# credentials anonymous
resource "harness_platform_connector_docker" "test" {
  identifier  = "identifer"
  name        = "name"
  description = "test"
  tags        = ["foo:bar"]

  type               = "DockerHub"
  url                = "https://hub.docker.com"
  delegate_selectors = ["harness-delegate"]
}

# credentials username password
resource "harness_platform_connector_docker" "test" {
  identifier  = "identifer"
  name        = "name"
  description = "test"
  tags        = ["foo:bar"]

  type               = "DockerHub"
  url                = "https://hub.docker.com"
  delegate_selectors = ["harness-delegate"]
  credentials {
    username     = "admin"
    password_ref = "account.secret_id"
  }
}
```
### Org Level
```terraform
# credentials anonymous
resource "harness_platform_connector_docker" "test" {
  identifier  = "identifer"
  name        = "name"
  description = "test"
  tags        = ["foo:bar"]
  org_id      = harness_platform_project.test.org_id

  type               = "DockerHub"
  url                = "https://hub.docker.com"
  delegate_selectors = ["harness-delegate"]
}

# credentials username password
resource "harness_platform_connector_docker" "test" {
  identifier  = "identifer"
  name        = "name"
  description = "test"
  tags        = ["foo:bar"]
  org_id      = harness_platform_project.test.org_id

  type               = "DockerHub"
  url                = "https://hub.docker.com"
  delegate_selectors = ["harness-delegate"]
  credentials {
    username     = "admin"
    password_ref = "account.secret_id"
  }
}
```
### Project Level
```terraform
# credentials anonymous
resource "harness_platform_connector_docker" "test" {
  identifier  = "identifer"
  name        = "name"
  description = "test"
  tags        = ["foo:bar"]
  org_id      = harness_platform_project.test.org_id
  project_id  = harness_platform_project.test.id

  type               = "DockerHub"
  url                = "https://hub.docker.com"
  delegate_selectors = ["harness-delegate"]
}

# credentials username password
resource "harness_platform_connector_docker" "test" {
  identifier  = "identifer"
  name        = "name"
  description = "test"
  tags        = ["foo:bar"]
  org_id      = harness_platform_project.test.org_id
  project_id  = harness_platform_project.test.id

  type               = "DockerHub"
  url                = "https://hub.docker.com"
  delegate_selectors = ["harness-delegate"]
  credentials {

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Import account level docker connector 
terraform import harness_platform_connector_docker.example <connector_id>

# Import org level docker connector 
terraform import harness_platform_connector_docker.example <ord_id>/<connector_id>
