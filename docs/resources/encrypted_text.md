## Example Usage

```terraform
data "harness_secret_manager" "default" {
  default = true
}

resource "harness_encrypted_text" "example" {
  name              = "example-secret"
  value             = "someval"
  secret_manager_id = data.harness_secret_manager.default.id

  usage_scope {
    environment_filter_type = "PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENTS"
  }

  usage_scope {
    environment_filter_type = "NON_PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENTS"
  }
}

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the encrypted text secret
- `secret_manager_id` (String) The id of the secret manager to associate the secret with. Once set, this field cannot be changed.

### Optional

- `inherit_scopes_from_secret_manager` (Boolean) Boolean that indicates whether or not to inherit the usage scopes from the secret manager
- `scoped_to_account` (Boolean) Boolean that indicates whether or not the secret is scoped to the account
- `secret_reference` (String) Name of the existing secret. If you already have secrets created in a secrets manager such as HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, you do not need to re-create the existing secrets in Harness.
- `usage_scope` (Block Set) This block is used for scoping the resource to a specific set of applications or environments. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--usage_scope))
- `value` (String, Sensitive) The value of the secret.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Id of the encrypted text secret

<a id="nestedblock--usage_scope"></a>
### Nested Schema for `usage_scope`

Optional:

- `application_id` (String) Id of the application to scope to. If empty then this scope applies to all applications.
- `environment_filter_type` (String) Type of environment filter applied. Cannot be used with `environment_id`. Valid options are NON_PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENTS, PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENTS.
- `environment_id` (String) Id of the id of the specific environment to scope to. Cannot be used with `environment_filter_type`.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Import using the Harness encrypted text format.
# NOTE: The secret value cannot be decrypted and imported.
terraform import harness_encrypted_text.example <secret_id>
```
