The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Import account level service now connector 
terraform import harness_platform_connector_service_now.example <connector_id>

# Import org level service now connector 
terraform import harness_platform_connector_service_now.example <ord_id>/<connector_id>

# Import project level service now connector 
terraform import harness_platform_connector_service_now.example <org_id>/<project_id>/<connector_id>
```
