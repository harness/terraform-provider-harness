  rego        = <<-REGO
    package pipeline

    # Deny pipelines that don't have an approval step
    # NOTE: Try removing the HarnessApproval step from your input to see the policy fail
    deny[msg] {
        # Find all stages that are Deployments ...
        input.pipeline.stages[i].stage.type == "Approval"

        # ... that are not in the set of stages with HarnessApproval steps
        not stages_with_approval[i]
