# harness_platform_connector_artifactory (Resource)

Resource for creating an Artifactory connector.

### References:
- For details on how to onboard with Terraform, please see [Harness Terraform Provider Overview](https://developer.harness.io/docs/platform/automation/terraform/harness-terraform-provider-overview/)
- To understand how to use the Connectors, please see [Documentation](https://developer.harness.io/docs/category/connectors)

## Example to create Artifactory Connector at different levels (Org, Project, Account)
### Account Level
```terraform
# Authentication mechanism as username and password
resource "harness_platform_connector_artifactory" "example" {
  identifier  = "identifier"
  name        = "name"
  description = "test"
  tags        = ["foo:bar"]
  
  url                = "https://artifactory.example.com"
  delegate_selectors = ["harness-delegate"]
  credentials {
    username     = "admin"
    password_ref = "account.secret_id"
  }
}

# Authentication mechanism as anonymous
resource "harness_platform_connector_artifactory" "test" {
  identifier  = "identifier"
  name        = "name"
  description = "test"
  tags        = ["foo:bar"]

  url                = "https://artifactory.example.com"
  delegate_selectors = ["harness-delegate"]
}
```

### Org Level
```terraform
# Authentication mechanism as username and password
resource "harness_platform_connector_artifactory" "example" {
  identifier  = "identifier"
  name        = "name"
  description = "test"
  tags        = ["foo:bar"]
  org_id      = harness_platform_project.test.org_id
  
  url                = "https://artifactory.example.com"
  delegate_selectors = ["harness-delegate"]
  credentials {
    username     = "admin"
    password_ref = "account.secret_id"
  }
}

# Authentication mechanism as anonymous
resource "harness_platform_connector_artifactory" "test" {
  identifier  = "identifier"
  name        = "name"
  description = "test"
  tags        = ["foo:bar"]
  org_id      = harness_platform_project.test.org_id

  url                = "https://artifactory.example.com"
  delegate_selectors = ["harness-delegate"]
}
```

### Project Level
```terraform
# Authentication mechanism as username and password
resource "harness_platform_connector_artifactory" "example" {
  identifier  = "identifier"
  name        = "name"
  description = "test"
  tags        = ["foo:bar"]
  org_id      = harness_platform_project.test.org_id
  project_id  = harness_platform_project.test.id
  
  url                = "https://artifactory.example.com"
  delegate_selectors = ["harness-delegate"]
  credentials {
    username     = "admin"
    password_ref = "account.secret_id"
  }
}

# Authentication mechanism as anonymous
resource "harness_platform_connector_artifactory" "test" {
  identifier  = "identifier"
  name        = "name"
  description = "test"
  tags        = ["foo:bar"]
  org_id      = harness_platform_project.test.org_id
  project_id  = harness_platform_project.test.id

  url                = "https://artifactory.example.com"
  delegate_selectors = ["harness-delegate"]
}
```
