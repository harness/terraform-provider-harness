# harness_platform_environment_clusters_mapping (Resource)

Resource for mapping environment with Harness Clusters.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# mapping a cluster to a project level env
resource "harness_platform_environment_clusters_mapping" "example" {
  identifier = "mycustomidentifier"
  org_id     = "orgIdentifer"
  project_id = "projectIdentifier"
  env_id     = "exampleEnvId"
  clusters {
    identifier       = "incluster"
    name             = "in-cluster"
    agent_identifier = "account.gitopsagentdev"
    scope            = "ACCOUNT"
  }
}


# mapping two clusters to account level env
resource "harness_platform_environment_clusters_mapping" "example2" {
  identifier = "mycustomidentifier"
  env_id     = "env1"
  clusters {
    identifier       = "clusterA"
    name             = "cluster-A"
    agent_identifier = "account.gitopsagentprod"
    scope            = "ACCOUNT"
  }
  clusters {
    identifier       = "clusterB"
    name             = "cluster-B"
    agent_identifier = "account.gitopsagentprod"
    scope            = "ACCOUNT"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `env_id` (String) environment identifier.
- `identifier` (String) identifier for the cluster mapping(can be given any value).

### Optional

- `clusters` (Block Set) list of cluster identifiers and names (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--clusters))
- `org_id` (String) org_id of the environment.
- `project_id` (String) project_id of the environment.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `scope` (String) scope at which the environment exists in harness.

<a id="nestedblock--clusters"></a>
### Nested Schema for `clusters`

Optional:

- `agent_identifier` (String) agent identifier of the cluster (include scope prefix)
- `identifier` (String) identifier of the cluster
- `name` (String) name of the cluster
- `scope` (String) scope at which the cluster exists in harness gitops, one of "ACCOUNT", "ORGANIZATION", "PROJECT". Scope of environment to which clusters are being mapped must be lower or equal to in hierarchy than the scope of the cluster

## Import
