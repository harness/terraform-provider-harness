# harness_platform_service (Resource)

Resource for creating a Harness project.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "harness_platform_service" "example" {
  identifier  = "identifier"
  name        = "name"
  description = "test"
  org_id      = "org_id"
  project_id  = "project_id"
  git_details {
    branch_name    = "branchName"
    commit_message = "commitMessage"
    file_path      = "filePath"
    connector_ref  = "connectorRef"
    store_type     = "REMOTE"
    repo_name      = "repoName"
  }

  ## SERVICE V2 UPDATE
  ## We now take in a YAML that can define the service definition for a given Service
  ## It isn't mandatory for Service creation 
  ## It is mandatory for Service use in a pipeline

  yaml = <<-EOT
                service:

  name            = "name"
  org_id          = "org_id"
  project_id      = "project_id"
  import_from_git = "true"
  git_details {
    store_type    = "REMOTE"
    connector_ref = "account.DoNotDeleteGitX"
    repo_name     = "pcf_practice"
    file_path     = ".harness/accountService.yaml"

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Import account level service 
terraform import harness_platform_service.example <service_id>

# Import org level service 
terraform import harness_platform_service.example <org_id>/<service_id>

# Import project level service 
terraform import harness_platform_service.example <org_id>/<project_id>/<service_id>
```
