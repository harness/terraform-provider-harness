## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Import account level pipeline filter
terraform import harness_platform_pipeline_filters.example <filter_id>/<type>

# Import org level pipeline filter
terraform import harness_platform_pipeline_filters.example <ord_id>/<filter_id>/<type>

# Import project level pipeline filter
terraform import harness_platform_pipeline_filters.example <org_id>/<project_id>/<filter_id>/<type>
```
