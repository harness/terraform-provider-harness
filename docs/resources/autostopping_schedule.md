## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the schedule
- `rules` (List of Number) ID of AutoStopping rules on which the schedule applies
- `schedule_type` (String) Type of the schedule. Valid values are `uptime` and `downtime`
- `time_zone` (String) Time zone in which schedule needs to be executed

### Optional

- `ending_on` (String) Time until which schedule will be active. Need to be in YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS format. Eg 2006-01-02 15:04:05

- `starting_from` (String) Time from which schedule will be active. Schedule will take immediate effect if starting_from is not specified. Need to be in YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS format. Eg 2006-01-02 15:04:05

### Read-Only
